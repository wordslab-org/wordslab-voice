    "   - Stream microphone audio continuously for transcription and processing\n",
    "4. **STT → Text Transcription**\n",
    "   - Server sends recognized transcription segments as items (`item.created`)\n",

    "2. Otherwise pulls next output (either generated audio OR structured event) from `handler.emit()`\n",
    "3. Encodes raw PCM samples using `OpusStreamWriter` → sends delta events containing base64 Opus-encoded audio\n",
    "4. Sends textual events directly as JSON payloads with `.model_dump_json()`\n",
    "5. Logs every outgoing server event to the recorder if applicable\n",

    "## **Real-World Usage Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "In `unmute_handler.py`, quests manage services:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# STT Quest\n",
    "async def start_up_stt(self):\n",
    "    async def _init() -> SpeechToText:\n",
    "        return await find_instance(\"stt\", SpeechToText)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    async def _run(stt: SpeechToText):\n",
    "        await self._stt_loop(stt)  # Process audio\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Key Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Cleanup**: Resources are always cleaned up, even on errors\n",
    "2. **Conflict Resolution**: Adding a quest with existing name cancels the old one\n",
    "3. **Exception Propagation**: Errors in any quest bubble up to main task\n",
    "4. **Structured Lifecycle**: Clear init/run/close phases prevent resource leaks\n",
    "5. **Cancellation Safety**: Proper task cancellation without leaving resources hanging\n",
    "\n",
    "This system provides robust service lifecycle management essential for real-time audio processing where services need to be dynamically created, replaced, and cleaned up without leaks or zombie processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# STT protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the code structure and patterns in your files, the STT (Speech-to-Text) service communication follows a WebSocket-based protocol with custom message types. Let me trace through the detailed protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **STT Service Communication Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Connection Establishment**\n",
    "The STT service is discovered and connected via:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In `quest_manager.py` and `unmute_handler.py`\n",
    "async def _init() -> SpeechToText:\n",
    "    return await find_instance(\"stt\", SpeechToText)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses service discovery to find and connect to the STT WebSocket server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Message Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Client → STT Service Messages**\n",
    "The main client-to-STT communication happens through audio streaming:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In `unmute_handler.py` receive() method\n",
    "await stt.send_audio(array)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sends PCM audio chunks to the STT service. The audio is likely wrapped in a protocol like:\n",
    "- Raw PCM frames\n",
    "- Timestamped audio packets\n",
    "- Session/context identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **STT Service → Client Messages**\n",
    "The STT service sends responses through async iteration:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In `unmute_handler.py` _stt_loop method\n",
    "async for data in stt:\n",
    "    if isinstance(data, STTMarkerMessage):\n",
    "        # Ignore marker messages\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Send transcription to client\n",
    "    await self.output_queue.put(\n",
    "        ora.ConversationItemInputAudioTranscriptionDelta(\n",
    "            delta=data.text,\n",
    "            start_time=data.start_time,\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Message Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the code, the STT service likely uses these message types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Input Messages (Client → STT)**:\n",
    "- **Audio Data**: PCM audio frames\n",
    "- **Session Control**: Start/stop transcription signals\n",
    "- **Configuration**: Language, model selection, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output Messages (STT → Client)**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From `stt/speech_to_text.py` (inferred structure):\n",
    "class STTMarkerMessage:\n",
    "    type: str = \"marker\"\n",
    "    # Internal synchronization markers\n",
    "\n",
    "class STTTranscriptionMessage:\n",
    "    type: str = \"transcription\"\n",
    "    text: str\n",
    "    start_time: float\n",
    "    end_time: float\n",
    "    confidence: float\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Protocol Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Connection Phase**:\n",
    "1. **Service Discovery**: `find_instance(\"stt\", SpeechToText)`\n",
    "2. **WebSocket Connection**: Establish connection to STT server\n",
    "3. **Session Initialization**: Send configuration (sample rate, language, etc.)\n",
    "4. **Ready Signal**: STT service acknowledges readiness\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Streaming Phase**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Continuous loop in _stt_loop\n",
    "async for data in stt:\n",
    "    # Real-time transcription results\n",
    "    # Partial results streamed as they become available\n",
    "    # Final results marked with confidence scores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Audio Streaming**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From unmute_handler.py\n",
    "await stt.send_audio(array)  # Send PCM audio chunks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol likely batches audio into frames and sends them continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Control Mechanisms**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pause Detection**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In unmute_handler.py\n",
    "if stt.pause_prediction.value > 0.6:\n",
    "    # Voice Activity Detection triggers pause detection\n",
    "    return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The STT service likely sends VAD (Voice Activity Detection) scores along with transcriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Flushing Mechanism**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# When pause detected, send silence to flush buffers\n",
    "num_frames = int(math.ceil(stt.delay_sec / FRAME_TIME_SEC)) + 1\n",
    "zero = np.zeros(SAMPLES_PER_FRAME, dtype=np.float32)\n",
    "for _ in range(num_frames):\n",
    "    await stt.send_audio(zero)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Error Handling Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Connection Errors**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In _stt_loop\n",
    "except websockets.ConnectionClosed:\n",
    "    logger.info(\"STT connection closed while receiving messages.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Service Unavailability**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In main_websocket.py via QuestManager\n",
    "except MissingServiceAtCapacity:\n",
    "    # Handle service overload\n",
    "except MissingServiceTimeout:\n",
    "    # Handle connection timeouts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Session Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Start Session**:\n",
    "- Connect to WebSocket\n",
    "- Send initial configuration\n",
    "- Begin audio streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **End Session**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In Quest cleanup\n",
    "async def _close(stt: SpeechToText):\n",
    "    await stt.shutdown()  # Graceful shutdown\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Timing and Synchronization**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Delay Compensation**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Account for processing delays\n",
    "self.stt_end_of_flush_time = stt.current_time + stt.delay_sec\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-time Factor (RTF) Monitoring**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rtf = stt.delay_sec / elapsed  # Processing speed vs real-time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Inferred Protocol Message Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the exact STT protocol isn't shown, based on the patterns, it likely uses JSON messages:\n",

    "### **10. Key Protocol Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real-time Streaming**: Continuous audio input with immediate partial results\n",
    "2. **VAD Integration**: Voice activity detection for pause/speech boundaries\n",
    "3. **Confidence Scoring**: Quality indicators for transcription accuracy\n",
    "4. **Session Boundaries**: Clear start/end of transcription sessions\n",
    "5. **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection and error handling\n",
    "6. **Timing Synchronization**: Timestamps for accurate alignment with other services\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the code in `unmute_handler.py` and related files, the LLM (Large Language Model) communication follows the **OpenAI API protocol** with some custom extensions. Let me break down the detailed protocol:\n",

    "# Mutiple users and sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the code, the system uses several mechanisms to manage distinct sessions for multiple users while sharing some resources appropriately. Let me break down how session isolation and resource management work:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Session Isolation Mechanisms**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Per-Connection Handler Instances**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each WebSocket connection gets its own **dedicated `UnmuteHandler` instance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In main_websocket.py\n",
    "async def websocket_route(websocket: WebSocket):\n",
    "    async with SEMAPHORE:\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            await websocket.accept(subprotocol=\"realtime\")\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # NEW INSTANCE PER CONNECTION\n",
    "            handler = UnmuteHandler()  # ← Fresh instance for each user\n",
    "            async with handler:\n",
    "                await handler.start_up()\n",
    "                await _run_route(websocket, handler)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures complete isolation - each user has their own:\n",
    "- Conversation state (`chatbot.chat_history`)\n",
    "- Audio processing queues\n",
    "- Service connections (STT, TTS, LLM)\n",
    "- Timing trackers and debug data\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Semaphore-Based Connection Limiting**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Global semaphore limits concurrent sessions\n",
    "MAX_CLIENTS = 4\n",
    "SEMAPHORE = asyncio.Semaphore(MAX_CLIENTS)\n",
    "\n",
    "# In websocket_route\n",
    "async with SEMAPHORE:  # Limits total concurrent users\n",
    "    # ... create handler and process session\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents resource exhaustion while ensuring each session gets dedicated resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Independent Service Connections**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each handler creates **independent connections** to backend services:\n",
    "\n",

    "    return await find_instance(\"tts\", factory)\n",

    "# Concurrent requests for STT\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at `batched_asr.py`, the system manages concurrent requests and GPU batching through a sophisticated batched processing approach. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Fixed-Size Batch Processing**\n",
    "The system operates on **fixed batch sizes** established at initialization:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "service = ASRService(batch_size=batch_size, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All operations process exactly `batch_size` items simultaneously, regardless of how many active clients there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Client Slot Management**\n",
    "Each batch slot represents a \"client slot\" managed by `ClientState`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class ClientState:\n",
    "    is_complete: bool = False\n",
    "    active: bool = False\n",
    "    offset: int = 0\n",
    "    real_end: int = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "def __post_init__(self):\n",
    "    self.clients = [ClientState() for _ in range(self.batch_size)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each slot can be in different states:\n",
    "- **Inactive**: No active request\n",
    "- **Active**: Processing audio data\n",
    "- **Complete**: Waiting for final processing after EOS marker\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Dynamic Execution Masking**\n",
    "The key innovation is **execution masking** that enables efficient sparse batching:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def step(self, ..., updates: list[int]) -> None:\n",
    "    # Build execution mask based on active clients\n",
    "    exec_mask = torch.tensor(\n",
    "        [client.active for client in self.clients],\n",
    "        dtype=torch.bool,\n",
    "        device=self.device,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Only process active slots\n",
    "    self.lm_gen.set_exec_mask(exec_mask)\n",
    "    self.mimi.set_exec_mask(exec_mask)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- **Inactive slots** consume minimal GPU resources (masked out)\n",
    "- **Only active slots** perform actual computation\n",
    "- **Batch operations** still run on full tensors, but masked portions do minimal work\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **State Management for Concurrent Requests**\n",
    "The system handles concurrent requests through:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Request Lifecycle:**\n",
    "1. **New Request**: Slot marked as `ACTIVE`\n",
    "2. **Ongoing Processing**: Continuous audio chunks processed\n",
    "3. **End Signal**: Client sends marker, system schedules final processing\n",
    "4. **Completion**: After delay (`asr_delay_in_tokens`), slot marked as `IS_EOS`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Handle different update types\n",
    "if update > 0:  # End marker received\n",
    "    self.clients[batch_idx].is_complete = True\n",
    "    self.clients[batch_idx].real_end = (\n",
    "        self.clients[batch_idx].offset \n",
    "        + update + self.asr_delay_in_tokens + 2\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **GPU Memory and Performance Optimization**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Warmup pre-allocates GPU memory for batched operations\n",
    "def __post_init__(self):\n",
    "    self.lm_gen.streaming_forever(self.batch_size)\n",
    "    self.mimi.streaming_forever(self.batch_size)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Pre-warm models with dummy data\n",
    "    for _ in range(3):\n",
    "        batch_zeros = torch.zeros((self.batch_size, 1, self.mimi.frame_size))\n",
    "        audio_tokens = self.mimi.encode(batch_zeros)\n",
    "        frame = self.lm_gen.step(audio_tokens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures:\n",
    "- **Consistent GPU memory usage** (fixed batch size)\n",
    "- **Eliminates dynamic allocation** during runtime\n",
    "- **Optimal tensor operations** on GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request Flow Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Batch arrives** with mixed active/inactive slots\n",
    "2. **Execution mask** filters to only active slots\n",
    "3. **Mimi model** encodes audio for all slots simultaneously:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   batch_pcm = batch_pcm.view(self.batch_size, frame_size).unsqueeze(1)\n",
    "   audio_tokens = self.mimi.encode(batch_pcm)  # Full batch operation\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **LM model** generates text with execution masking:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   text_tokens, extra_heads = self.lm_gen.step_with_extra_heads(audio_tokens)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. **State updates** for each slot based on progress\n",
    "6. **Results returned** for all slots simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximized GPU Utilization**: Batched operations even with sparse activity\n",
    "- **Predictable Performance**: Fixed memory and computation patterns\n",
    "- **Scalable Concurrency**: Batch size determines maximum concurrent requests\n",
    "- **Efficient Resource Use**: Inactive slots consume minimal GPU resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The system essentially trades some theoretical efficiency (processing empty slots) for practical benefits like predictable performance and simplified GPU memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concurrent requests for TTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at `tts.rs`, the GPU batching and concurrent request handling is quite different from the ASR system. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single Request Processing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Mutex-Based Concurrency Control**\n",
    "The TTS system uses a simple mutex to ensure **only one inference can run at a time**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "pub struct Model {\n",
    "    // ... other fields\n",
    "    pub(crate) mutex: tokio::sync::Mutex<()>,  // Dummy way to ensure only single inference\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "pub async fn handle_socket(&self, socket: ws::WebSocket, query: crate::TtsStreamingQuery) -> Result<()> {\n",
    "    let _guard = self.mutex.lock().await;  // Only one request processed at a time\n",
    "    // ... processing logic\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- **No batched parallel processing** like in ASR\n",
    "- **Sequential request handling** - each request blocks others\n",
    "- **Single GPU context** used per request\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Per-Request GPU State Management**\n",
    "Each TTS request creates its own independent state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let mut state = moshi::tts_streaming::State::new(\n",
    "    self.lm.clone(),                    // Shared model weights\n",
    "    Some(moshi::transformer::CaSrc::Tokens(ca_src)),  // Per-request voice conditioning\n",
    "    max_seq_len,\n",
    "    audio_lp, text_lp,\n",
    "    query.cfg_alpha,\n",
    "    config.clone(),\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model weights are shared, but each request has:\n",
    "- **Independent generation state**\n",
    "- **Independent voice conditioning** (ca_src)\n",
    "- **Independent logits processors** (sampling parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Streaming Pipeline Architecture**\n",
    "For WebSocket streaming, the system uses a **three-thread pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let recv_loop = tokio::task::spawn(async move { /* Socket input */ });\n",
    "let process_loop = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move { /* TTS generation */ });\n",
    "let send_loop = tokio::task::spawn(async move { /* Socket output */ });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows:\n",
    "- **Non-blocking socket I/O** (recv/send loops)\n",
    "- **Blocking computation** in process loop\n",
    "- **Independent timing** for each component\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **GPU Memory Management**\n",
    "The system handles GPU memory through:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// Voice conditioning can load custom voice files\n",
    "let ca_src = self.voice_ca_src(query.voice.as_ref(), query.voices.as_ref())?;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Model weights shared but state is per-request\n",
    "let mut state = moshi::tts_streaming::State::new(...);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Audio tokenizer reset per request\n",
    "let mut audio_tokenizer = self.audio_tokenizer.clone();\n",
    "audio_tokenizer.reset_state();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences from ASR Batched System\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | ASR System | TTS System |\n",
    "|--------|------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Concurrency** | Batched parallel processing | Sequential with mutex |\n",
    "| **GPU Utilization** | Fixed-size batch tensors | Single request tensors |\n",
    "| **State Management** | Slot-based client states | Per-request independent state |\n",
    "| **Throughput** | High (batched) | Low (sequential) |\n",
    "| **Latency** | Higher per request | Lower per request |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request Arrives**: Mutex ensures only one runs\n",
    "2. **State Initialization**: Creates independent TTS generation state\n",
    "3. **Voice Conditioning**: Loads/encodes speaker voice if needed\n",
    "4. **Generation Loop**: Processes tokens one by one in sequence\n",
    "5. **Audio Decoding**: Converts tokens to PCM audio chunks\n",
    "6. **Streaming Output**: Sends audio chunks back via WebSocket\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPU Underutilization**: Single requests don't fully utilize GPU capacity\n",
    "- **Higher Latency for Concurrent Users**: Requests queue behind each other\n",
    "- **Consistent Per-Request Performance**: No interference between requests\n",
    "- **Simpler Error Handling**: Failures are isolated to single requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The design prioritizes **simplicity and quality** over throughput - typical for TTS systems where generation quality is more critical than handling many concurrent users.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TTS batch size meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the code more carefully, I need to correct my analysis. The `batch_size` parameter in the TTS config likely refers to **internal model batching** rather than concurrent request handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the `batch_size` Parameter Actually Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "The `batch_size` parameter in TTS configuration most likely controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Internal Model Batch Processing**\n",
    "Even though requests are processed sequentially, the underlying models (LM and Mimi) may still use batching internally for efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// In the model initialization, we see references to batched operations\n",
    "let mut audio_tokenizer = self.audio_tokenizer.clone();\n",
    "audio_tokenizer.reset_state();\n",
    "// The tokenizer is likely configured for a specific batch size\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Voice Conditioning Batching**\n",
    "When processing multiple voices or speakers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "pub fn voice_ca_src(\n",
    "    &self,\n",
    "    voice: Option<&String>,\n",
    "    voices: Option<&Vec<String>>,  // Multiple voices processed together\n",
    ") -> Result<Tensor> {\n",
    "    // When voices is Some(Vec), multiple voice embeddings are batched together\n",
    "    for voice in voices.iter() {\n",
    "        // Process each voice...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    Ok(self.speaker_encoder.encode(&pcms)?)  // Batch encoding\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Tensor Operations Batch Dimensions**\n",
    "The batch size affects how tensors are shaped and processed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// Operations likely use the configured batch size for tensor dimensions\n",
    "let audio_tokens = candle::Tensor::from_vec(audio_tokens, (1, cb, 1), state.device())?;\n",
    "// The first dimension (1) would be batch_size in batched operations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real Purpose of `batch_size` in TTS Config\n",
    "\n",
    "The `batch_size` parameter is used for:\n",
    "- **Configuring model internal states** to expect certain batch dimensions\n",
    "- **Voice embedding batching** when processing multiple speakers\n",
    "- **Memory allocation planning** for GPU tensors\n",
    "- **Consistency with shared model infrastructure** that expects batched operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Requests Are Still Sequential\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequential processing (mutex) is separate from the internal batch size configuration because:\n",
    "- **TTS Quality**: Real-time TTS often requires consistent, low-latency responses per user\n",
    "- **Voice Personalization**: Each request may use different voice conditioning\n",
    "- **State Management Complexity**: Managing multiple concurrent generation states is complex\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "tts:\n",
    "  batch_size: 4  # Internal model batch size\n",
    "  # This allows the model to handle batched tensor operations efficiently\n",
    "  # but concurrent HTTP/WebSocket requests are still processed one at a time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the `batch_size` parameter optimizes the **internal computation efficiency** rather than enabling **concurrent request processing**. The actual request concurrency is controlled separately by the server's request handling architecture (the mutex in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mimi and lm\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at `mimi.rs` and `lm.rs`, I can now see how they integrate into the multi-user architecture. The key insight is that these modules handle **real-time streaming** differently from the batched ASR system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-User Architecture with GPU Batching\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Room-Based Broadcasting System**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mimi.rs` module implements a **room-based broadcasting** architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "struct Room {\n",
    "    sender: Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<Sender>>,\n",
    "    header_message: ws::Message,\n",
    "    rx: tokio::sync::broadcast::Receiver<ws::Message>,\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "struct Mimi {\n",
    "    rooms: std::collections::HashMap<String, Room>,\n",
    "    // ... other fields\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows:\n",
    "- **Multiple users per room** receiving the same audio stream\n",
    "- **Single sender per room** broadcasting to all receivers\n",
    "- **Broadcast channel** for efficient distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Real-Time Streaming vs Batched Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the batched ASR system, `mimi.rs` and `lm.rs` are designed for **real-time streaming**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// In mimi.rs - processing individual audio chunks as they arrive\n",
    "Ok(MsgType::Codes) => {\n",
    "    let codes: Vec<u32> = msg[1..]\n",
    "        .chunks_exact(4)\n",
    "        .map(|chunk| u32::from_le_bytes([chunk[0], chunk[1], chunk[2], chunk[3]]))\n",
    "        .collect();\n",
    "    let ncodes = codes.len();\n",
    "    let codes = Tensor::from_vec(codes, (1, ncodes, 1), &self.device)?;  // Batch size = 1\n",
    "    let pcm = audio_tokenizer.decode_step(&codes.into(), &().into())?;\n",
    "    // ... process individual PCM chunks\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **GPU Batch Size Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `batch_size` parameter affects these modules through:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensor Shape Configuration:**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// The tensor is shaped with batch dimension = 1 for real-time processing\n",
    "let codes = Tensor::from_vec(codes, (1, ncodes, 1), &self.device)?;\n",
    "// But the underlying model is configured for batch_size during initialization\n",
    "let audio_tokenizer = moshi::mimi::load(&mimi.audio_tokenizer_file, Some(8), dev)?;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Initialization:**\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// In both mimi.rs and lm.rs - models are loaded with batch size awareness\n",
    "let audio_tokenizer = moshi::mimi::load(&lm.audio_tokenizer_file, Some(8), dev)?;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Multi-User Integration Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how multi-user requests integrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audio Reception (`mimi.rs`):**\n",
    "1. **Single sender** connects and sends audio codes\n",
    "2. **Real-time decoding** happens with batch_size=1 tensors\n",
    "3. **Broadcasting** to all room participants\n",
    "4. **Multiple receivers** get the same decoded audio stream\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language Modeling (`lm.rs`):**\n",
    "1. **Single WebSocket** connection processes incoming audio\n",
    "2. **Real-time token generation** with batch_size=1 operations\n",
    "3. **Text and audio responses** sent back over WebSocket\n",
    "4. **Broadcasting** text transcriptions/audio to connected clients\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Why Not Full Batching?**\n",
    "\n",
    "These modules don't use full batching because:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// Real-time constraints - can't wait to fill a batch\n",
    "while let Some(opus) = opus_in_rx.recv().await {\n",
    "    // Process immediately as chunks arrive\n",
    "    let pcm = Tensor::new(pcm, &dev)?.reshape((1, 1, ()))?;  // Immediate processing\n",
    "    // ... immediate token generation\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons:**\n",
    "- **Latency requirements** - users expect real-time responses\n",
    "- **Variable arrival times** - users don't send data synchronously\n",
    "- **Individual user contexts** - each user may have different state\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Batch Size Parameter Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `batch_size` in config serves to:\n",
    "- **Pre-allocate GPU memory** for tensor operations\n",
    "- **Configure model internal states** to handle batched operations efficiently\n",
    "- **Maintain consistency** with shared model infrastructure\n",

    "  # Each room allows exactly 1 producer + unlimited consumers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## No Dynamic Load Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The server notably **lacks** dynamic load management:\n",
    "- **No queueing systems** (except implicit OS-level connection queues)\n",
    "- **No resource monitoring** or adaptive refusal\n",
    "- **No load-based scaling** decisions\n",
    "- **Fixed resource allocation** based on configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Client Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ASR Clients**: Refused when all `batch_size` slots full\n",
    "2. **TTS Clients**: Blocked until previous client finishes (de facto refusal under load)\n",
    "3. **MIMI Clients**: Refused immediately if room producer slot taken\n",
    "4. **LM Clients**: May timeout or be refused at system level under high load\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is designed for **predictable, fixed-capacity operation** rather than elastic scaling, with refusal decisions based purely on **pre-configured limits** rather than dynamic system load assessment.\n",

    "### 3. **Batched Mask Handling**\n",
    "The system uses `IndicesAndMask` to efficiently handle batched attention masks:\n",

    "    None => candle::bail!(\"batched-transformer expects a mask\"),\n",
    "    Some(m) => self.builder.indices_and_mask(t, m)?,\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. **Streaming Processing Interface**\n",
    "The transformer implements a streaming interface for incremental processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "impl StreamingModule for StreamingTransformer {\n",
    "    fn reset_state(&mut self) {\n",
    "        self.builder.reset();  // Reset all batch KV caches\n",

    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Batched Memory Management**\n",
    "- Pre-allocated KV caches for all batch elements\n",
    "- Efficient memory reuse across time steps\n",
    "- Context window management to limit memory usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Flexible Positional Embeddings**\n",
    "Support for multiple positional embedding types:\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let rope = match cfg.positional_embedding {\n",
    "    PositionalEmbedding::Rope => Some(RotaryEmbedding::new(...)?),\n",
    "    PositionalEmbedding::None | PositionalEmbedding::Sin => None,\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cross-Attention Support**\n",
    "Optional cross-attention layers with shared parameters:\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let cross_attn = match cfg.cross_attention.map(|v| v.1) {\n",
    "    Some(norm_type) => {\n",
    "        let norm_cross = Norm::new_shortcut(d_model, norm_type, vb.pp(\"norm_cross\"))?;\n",

    "            Some(shared_vb) => StreamingMultiheadCrossAttention::new(\n",
    "                cfg, shared_vb.pp(\"cross_attention\"), Some(vb.pp(\"cross_attention.gate\")),\n",
    "            )?,\n",
    "        };\n",
    "        Some((norm_cross, cross_attn))\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    None => None,\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Projection Layers**\n",
    "Input/output projections for dimension matching:\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "pub struct ProjectedTransformer {\n",
    "    transformer: StreamingTransformer,\n",
    "    input_proj: Option<MaybeQuantizedLinear>,    // Project input to model dim\n",
    "    output_projs: Vec<Option<MaybeQuantizedLinear>>, // Project outputs to target dims\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Batch Processing Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Create transformer with fixed `batch_size`\n",
    "2. **Batched Forward Pass**: Process batch of sequences simultaneously\n",
    "3. **KV Cache Updates**: Append new keys/values to batched caches\n",
    "4. **Context Management**: Trim old cache entries beyond context window\n",
    "5. **Streaming Steps**: Process one time step at a time for real-time applications\n",
    "6. **Batch Reset**: Reset specific batch indices when sequences complete\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Pre-allocated batched caches eliminate fragmentation\n",
    "- **Computational Efficiency**: Batched tensor operations maximize GPU utilization\n",
    "- **Streaming Capability**: Incremental processing for real-time applications\n",
    "- **Context Management**: Automatic handling of long sequences with sliding windows\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is designed for scenarios where you need to process multiple sequences efficiently, either in batch mode for throughput or in streaming mode for low-latency applications."
