    "\"This is a cascaded system made by Kyutai: our speech-to-text transcribes what you say, an LLM (we use Mistral Small 24B) generates the text of the response, and we then use our text-to-speech model to say it out loud.\n",

    "Although cascaded systems lose valuable information like emotion, irony, etc., they provide unmatched modularity: since the three parts are separate, you can Unmute any LLM you want without any finetuning or adaptation! In this demo, you can get a feel for this versatility by tuning the system prompt of the LLM to handcraft the personality of your digital interlocutor, and independently changing the voice of the TTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the speech-to-text and text-to-speech models are optimized for low latency. The STT model is streaming and integrates semantic voice activity detection instead of relying on an external model. The TTS is streaming both in audio and in text, meaning it can start speaking before the entire LLM response is generated. You can use a 10-second voice sample to determine the TTS's voice and intonation. Check out the pre-print for details.\"\n",
